I'm currently working on a browser game titled _Codename: Wildberry_. It's a choices-matter narrative adventure, similar mechanically to games like Reigns and Suzerain.

The game is inspired from Universal Paperclips and covers scenarios and conceps discussed in the following AI Safety course: https://www.aisafetybook.com/virtual-course

You play the role of the CEO of an AI company called Alternative Manifolds, and must make decisions that help guide humanity towards a utopia while avoiding several catastrophic risks.

I'm developing the game in Twine (Harlowe) and am done with setting up the mechanics and the main plot. Major work is pending writing the characters and scenes, and there are no images as of now. 

When the game is playable, I will edit this post to add a link below.
