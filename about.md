I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University, pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence. 

At the moment, I'm interning as an Applied Scientist at [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com/), where I'm conducting research on retrieval-augmented generation, using GPT-4 and vector databases. I'm also developing a prototype search tool based on said research, and conducting experiments using it.

I've previously worked as a data scientist and as a software development engineer at [Flipkart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart). My areas of focus there were NLP, information retrieval (search), logistics planning problems, and high-throughput Java microservices. 

### Things I Care About

My primary interests are the study of intelligence, both human and artificial, and both the modern and classical approaches to AI. 

Over the last decade, I have increasingly focused my attention on educating myself about [AI Alignment Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment), and the societal and existential risks posed by current and future artificial intelligence agents in case we fail to solve the control problem. 

Linguistics and Game Theory are two other disciplines I deeply care about.

### More About Me

In my off time, I read, play the guitar, PC games, and board games, learn Japanese, and watch animated TV shows from the 90s that none of my friends want to talk to me about.
