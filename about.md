I'm a Senior Applied Scientist at [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com/), researching and experimenting with the capabilities and limits of large language models like GPT-4.1, and integrating their capabilities into legal data intelligence software. My work also utilizes statistical analysis and information retrieval.

I graduated from [Northwestern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University) in late 2023 with an MS in Artificial Intelligence.

I've previously worked as a data scientist and as a software development engineer at [Flipkart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart). My areas of focus there were NLP, information retrieval (search), shipment logistics automation, and web-scale Java microservices. 

I'm also a proud graduate of [BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani), Hyderabad Campus.

### Things I Care About

My primary interest is the study of intelligence, both human and artificial. Over the last decade, I have increasingly focused my attention on educating myself ([and hopefully others](/ai-alignment)) about [AI Alignment Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment), and the societal and existential risks posed by current and future artificial intelligence agents in case we fail to solve the control problem.

Linguistics and Game Theory are two other disciplines I deeply care about.

### More About Me

In my off time, I read, play {the {guitar, keyboard}, {PC, board, TTRP} games}, learn languages, and watch animated TV shows from the 90s that none of my friends want to talk to me about.
