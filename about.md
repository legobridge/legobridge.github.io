I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University, pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence. I've previously worked as a data scientist and as a software development engineer at [Flipkart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart). My areas of focus were NLP, specifically product search, logistics planning problems, and high throughput Java microservices. 

My primary interests are the study of intelligence, both human and artificial, and both the modern and classical approaches to AI. Linguistics and Game Theory are two other disciplines I deeply care about.

On my off time, I read, play the guitar, play board games, learn Japanese, and watch animated shows from the 90s that none of my friends want to talk to me about.
