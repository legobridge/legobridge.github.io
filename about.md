I'm currently a software development engineer at [Flipkart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart), working on logistics planning problems and high throughput Java microservices. My primary interests are the study of intelligence, both human and artificial, and both the modern and classical approaches to AI. Linguistics and Game Theory are two other disciplines I am into.

### More Information

On my off time, I read, play PC games, play music, learn Japanese, and watch animated shows from the 90s that none of my friends want to talk to me about.
